Hello my name is Martin and today I'm going to interview you!
Can you please introduce yourself?
-Hi my name is Stoil and I'm from Bulgaria. I'm a student on the 4th semester.
Can you share what are your hobbies?
-I like to travel and enjoy different cuisine around the world!
Have you ever used an app to find for example details about specific painting?
-Not really but would be a great idea to have one
So you think that such an app is going to be of great use for everyone?
-Yes indeed it's gonna be helpful if i ever see something interesting and i want to know more about it
What functionality do you think would be useful for such an app?
-Well what I'm imagining probably up that can scan the painting and it can output information about the painting like how was the process of creating the painting or probably there is gonna be a really interesting conspiracy factor theory that's probably involved of the process of creating the painting.
How do you imagine the design to look like should it be more simple or more complex?
-Of course the beauty is in the simplicity so it's gonna be really cool it's really simple.
Thank you for your input I'm going to forward this to my team and start working, thank you!
